## Description
This application allows users to manage data tables efficiently and expediently. While this example focuses on business or company needs, it can be utilized by anyone to manage any type of datasets. The database is built with MySQL and seamlessly interacts with JavaScript through the sequelize dependency. By utilizing this approach, the need for complex and convoluted query statements is eliminated, once the initial setup for file structures and table connections is complete.
